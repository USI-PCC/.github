## About

Welcome to the [**People-Centered Computing Lab**](https://pc.inf.usi.ch/) repository! This is the main code and data sharing platform for our research group at the Faculty of Informatics, UniversitÃ  della Svizzera italiana (USI) in Lugano, Switzerland.

## Our Mission

Our lab focuses on developing computing systems that put people at the center of the design process. We believe that technology should be useful, usable, and aligned with human values and preferences.

## Research Areas

### ðŸ”¬ Smart Sensing Systems
Miniature sensors promise to revolutionize the way our systems can understand our current context. We develop novel sensing technologies and applications for ubiquitous computing environments.

### ðŸ‘¥ Human Computer Interaction
Computer systems must be useful, usable, and attractive to use. We research how to design interfaces and interactions that truly serve human needs and capabilities.

### ðŸ”’ Security and Privacy
How can we ensure personal data is used in accordance with one's preferences? We develop privacy-preserving technologies and study usable security solutions.

### ðŸ“± Mobile and Wearable Systems
What are effective and efficient ways to build and maintain mobile and wearable systems? We create innovative applications for personal health monitoring, affective computing, and context-aware services.
